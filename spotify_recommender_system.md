# Spotifys Recommender System

- Bandits for Recommendations as Treatments (BaRT)
- collaborative and content-based filtering
- also uses NLP to analyze news, articles, blogs about songs and artists (for weekly playlist)

## Collaborative filtering
- Based off of other peoples playlists, add songs to your own, if the songs overlap. Similar to Netflixs "You may also like" or Amazons "Customers have also bought"
- Matrix manipulation
- uses your listening data and listening data of others to recommend songs
- does not recommend songs no one has listened to before: cold start problem

## Content based filtering
- anaylze song itself (spectrogram, frequencies over time)
- spectrogram is fed into a convolutional neural network (CNN)

## Natural Language Processing
- scan internet to find articles, blogs, and online reviews talking about artists and songs
- use the descriptors used in those to compute importance of artist or song and generate "cultural vectors" with weight
- the terms associated with the cultural vectors for a song or artist are used to compare similarity between artists and songs a user listens to and freshly released music
